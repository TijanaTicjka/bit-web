o They are used by the user for uploading the pictures of them and
showing what they looked like before they started working out, and
how they look now
● The page has to have an area where the user can put a picture description
● At the end of the form, there should be a submit button with text "Send" that is used to submit the form
● The form is submitted on page "handle-upload.html" and the user is
redirected to it upon pressing the button
